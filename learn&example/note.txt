Method          | Arguments                     | Details
--------------- | ----------------------------- | ---
add             | `id`, `parentId`, `item**`    | Add a new node hierarchy with a unique `id`, a parent with `parentId` as wll as `item` dictionary holding its data. This method internally constructs this hierarchy tree. The dictionary must contains a value for key 'name'. Please note that you can do in both approaches top-down or bottom-up.
getTree         | `rootId`, `getIdOnly`=False   | Return a tree-structured tuple of the hierarchy related to the `rootId` specify. Can choose to retrieve only ids or the whole items by tagging `getIdOnly`.
getChildrenOf   | `perentId`, `getIdOnly`=False | Return a list of children of the parent with `parentId`. Can choose to retrieve only ids or the whole items by tagging `getIdOnly`.
parentOf        | `childId`                     | Return id of the parent ascending to the child with `childId`. If there is no parent, None would be returned.
hasParent       | `childId`                     | Return a boolean indicating the existence of the parent of the child with the `childId`.
hasChildren     | `parentid`                    | Return a boolean indicating the existence of the child of the parent with the `parentId`.
removeById      | `id`                          | Remove a node with the `id` as well as all of its sub-coordinates.
getIds          | -                             | Return a list of all node ids in the current hierarchy tree model.
getItemOf       | `id`                          | Return the item dictionary held by the node with `id`.
getNameOf       | `id`                          | Return the name of node with the `id`
